task
task
description
this
task
focuses
on
the
problem
of
predicting
how
memorable
a
video
is
to
viewers
it
requires
participants
to
automatically
predict
memorability
scores
for
videos
that
reflect
the
probability
a
video
will
be
remembered
task
participants
are
provided
with
an
extensive
dataset
of
videos
that
are
accompanied
by
memorability
annotations
as
well
as
pre-extracted
state-of-the-art
visual
features
the
ground
truth
has
been
collected
through
recognition
tests
and
thus
results
from
objective
measurement
of
memory
performance
participants
will
be
required
to
train
computational
models
capable
of
inferring
video
memorability
from
visual
content
optionally
descriptive
titles
attached
to
the
videos
may
be
used
models
will
be
evaluated
through
standard
evaluation
metrics

ranking

this

focuses
on
understanding
the
patterns
in
the
data
and
improving
the
ability
of
algorithms
to
capture
those
patterns
task
motivation
and
background
the
motivation
for
the
task
is
the
growth
over
recent
years
in
the
amount
of
multimedia
content
shared
and
consumed
via
online
platforms
enhancing
the
usefulness
of
multimedia
requires
new
ways
to
organize–in
particular
to
recommend
and
retrieve–digital
content
like
other
aspects
related
to
video
relevance
such
as
aesthetics
or
interestingness
memorability
can
be
regarded
as
useful
to
help
make
a
choice
between
competing
videos
effective
memorability
prediction
models
will
also
push
forward
the
semantic
understanding
of
multimedia
content
by
putting
human
cognition
and
perception
at
the
center
of
the
multimedia
analysis
a
number
of
different
application
areas
benefit
from
deeper
understanding
of
what
makes
some
videos
memorable
and
others
less
so
these
areas
include
recommendation
and
retrieval
in
online
platforms
already
mentioned
but
also
advertising
filmmaking
and
education
it
is
increasingly
important
to
understand
what
makes
videos
memorable
in
order
to
keep
the
use
of
automatic
processing
techniques
evenhanded
applications
can
make
use
of
information
about
predicted
memorability
but
it
is
important
to
understand
memorability
well
enough
to
be
able
to
avoid
systems
that
are
hyper-optimized
to
viewer
responses
target
group
researchers
will
find
this
task
interesting
if
they
work
in
the
areas
of
human
perception
and
the
impact
of
multimedia
on
perception
such
as
image
and
video
interestingness
memorability
attractiveness

though
not
limited
to

the
dataset
is
composed
of
10,000
soundless
short
videos
extracted
from
raw
footage
used
by
professionals
when
creating
content
and
in
particular
commercials
each
video
consists
of
a
coherent
unit
in
terms
of
meaning
and
is
associated
with
two
scores
of
memorability
that
refer
to
its
probability
to
be
remembered
after
two
different
durations
of
memory
retention
the
videos
are
shared
under
creative

that
allow
their

they
come
